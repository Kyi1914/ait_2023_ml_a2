## A2 - Car Price Prediction with customized code for linear regression model

## Brief Introduction about this project

In this repository, I developed a model to predict car prices for the Chaky Company. The dataset I utilized was the 'Cars.csv' dataset. I performed various data preparation steps such as data cleaning and label encoding, among others. You can find detailed information about the steps I took in my Jupyter notebook (A2-CarPricePrediction.ipynb), which I highly recommend reading.

## Quick start

To explore this project, you'll need Docker or a compiler that can interpret Jupyter notebooks, along with an IDE like VScode.

    Tools and Technologies:
        -- Python
        -- Jupyter Notebooks
        -- MLflow
        -- Docker
        -- VSCode


### Accessing Experimentation:

This project involves the prediction of car prices using various machine learning models. It includes extensive experimentation with hyperparameters and model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2). Detailed experimentation and results can be found in the Jupyter Notebook named "A2-CarPricePrediction.ipynb." This notebook contains a record of the various hyperparameter settings, cross-validation results, and model evaluations using MSE and R2 scores.

### Challenges:

The project acknowledges the presence of certain issues or bugs within the model, resulting in less-than-optimal MSE and R2 scores. These challenges represent opportunities for further improvement and refinement.

### About Deployment:

The best-performing model is deployed, allowing easy access and testing by users.

## Conclusion:

I summarized the outcomes of these experiments at the end of the my Jupyter notebook. The deployed model is available for testing, and MLflow's tracking capabilities ensure that all experiments and their outcomes are documented for reference and future work.

Thank you for your interest in my project.
